# PROJECT
#
# Tell radi what components are a part of the project
# so that it knows what handlers to use for different
# operations.
# This allows a project to mix elements of different
# service provides.
# A builder can be used repeatedly, if it knows how to
# handle being called repeatedly.
#
# Builders can be passed settings in this file, but 
# typically builders will also have their own yml files
# for settings, especially in complex cases.
