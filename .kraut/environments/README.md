# Environments

In this folder should be kept various other scope folders
which can be used to override project settings, if kraut
is told that the environment is active.

The primary purpose for environments is to allow for
alternate settings to be used for production and staging
settings.

# Feature branches

This approach could be used also to support feature
branching, but likely some additional functionality will
be used.
